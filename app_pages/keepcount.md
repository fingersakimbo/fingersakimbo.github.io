You're at a baseball or softball game (or even kickball), watching your kid totally dominate the other team,
but all the parents are continually asking each other "what's the score?", "what's the count?" because these
youth games almost never have a scoreboard available.  I know, I've been there.

What you need is _Keep the Count_.  A fancier version of the batter count tracker in the umpire's hand, _Keep the Count_
will allow you to easily track the current count and current score.  Track as much or as little as you like. _Keep the Count_
doesn't force you to use it any particular way.

Show your team spirit by customizing your scoreboard to your team color.

_Keep the Count_ is coming soon, only on the iPhone App Store.
