Does your employer use a point system, where your absences, call-ins, and/or leaving early are tracked by accumulating
points that expire on some future date? Does getting too many points during a time period result in penalty or, worse,
termination? It's certainly nice to know where you stand before you risk another call-in.

_Points_ allows you to easily keep track of your HR points, to quickly see where you stand, and when they expire next.
Check the graph to see your trend, and where you'll be over the next few months. See how soon that next point drops off.

With flexible configuration options, it supports full- and half-points, earned credits, and date- or
event-based "fresh starts". You can set the appropriate expiration window for your company, and even get notifications
when points expire. Whatever your company policy is, Points will handle it.
