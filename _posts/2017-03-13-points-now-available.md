title: Points is now Available
---
We're pleased to announce that [Points] is now available in the iPhone App Store.

Like the original version from [BigSprocket], [Points] allows you to keep track of your points and absences, if your company's HR department uses
a rotating time-based point system, as is common in large companies.

See the [app's page][points] for more information.
