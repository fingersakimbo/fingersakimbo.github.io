It sure has been quiet around here. Let's change that. There's a new app in the works, and there's a
lot to talk about.

I prefer to spend my time writing the actual _code_, of course. But, over the next several weeks I'll talk
about what the app is, the motivation behind it, the challenges that Apple is presenting as I try to do my thing,
and since the app is basically worthless without the efforts of others, I'll talk about them a lot too.

Stay tuned.
